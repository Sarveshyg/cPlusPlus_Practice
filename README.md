# C++ Learning Journey ðŸš€  

This repository contains my progress while learning **C++ from scratch**.  
Iâ€™ll be uploading codes, examples, and small projects as I explore the language.  

### Topics Iâ€™ll Cover  
- [ ] Basics (syntax, variables, loops, functions)  
- [ ] Object-Oriented Programming (classes, inheritance, polymorphism)  
- [ ] Standard Template Library (STL)  
- [ ] Data Structures & Algorithms  
- [ ] Mini Projects  

### Running Code  
```bash
g++ filename.cpp -o output
./output
```
